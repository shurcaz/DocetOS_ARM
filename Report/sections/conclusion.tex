\section{Conclusion}
To summarise, we have enhanced the capabilities and expanded the functionality of the real-time operating system DocetOS, along with reducing the systems vulnerability to bugs and unexpected behaviour by implementing:
\begin{itemize}[]
	\item Fixed-Priority Scheduling
	\item Task Sleeping
	\item A Re-entrant Mutex
	\item Mutex Priority Inheritance
	\item An improved Wait and Notify System
	\item A Memory Pool
\end{itemize}
These features then allow us to demonstrate the expanded operation of the operating system by simulating the collection and transmission of data from a device that has multiple tasks of various priority attempting to operate peripheral resources concurrently, while miscellaneous tasks operate in the background. A function not easily accomplished by the original system, if at all.
