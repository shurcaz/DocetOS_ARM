\section{Executive Summary}
This report outlines several significant enhancements to the operation of the DocetOS embedded operating system, aimed at expanding the toolset available to users while maintaining robustness and compatibility with low-performance systems. The focus of these modifications is the implementation of fixed-priority scheduling, mutual exclusivity through the integration of a re-entrant mutex, and task management systems such as sleeping and inter-task communications.\hfill\break

\noindent\textbf{Key Modifications:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fixed-Priority Scheduling
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Introduction of a fixed-priority scheduling algorithm to prioritise tasks based on predetermined priorities
		\item Enhances control over task execution
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Task Sleeping
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Integration of a sleep orientated wait list to pause the execution of tasks for set periods
		\item Expands functionality of tasks
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Re-entrant Mutex
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Introduction of a re-entrant mutex to facilitate exclusive access to a shared resource
		\item Ensures consistency in data access and prevents race conditions
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Mutex Priority Inheritance
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Integration of priority inheritance of tasks owning a mutex with a higher priority task in the mutex waiting list
		\item Prevents priority inversion issues and streamlines the execution of critical tasks
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Wait and Notify System
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Overhaul of the system managing waiting and notification of tasks by splitting the centralised waiting list into individual sorted waiting lists per blocking item.
		\item Enhances speed of task verification and notification
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Memory Pool
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Introduction of a memory pool allowing the reservation of memory for use during system run time
		\item Consolidates memory management and gives the ability to define maximum system OS memory allocation at runtime
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Task Communication
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Integration of a queue-based task communication system, utilising a memory pool to allow the transfer of data across tasks
		\item Introduces cooperation between tasks towards a common goal
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Benefits:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Improved Determinism
	\item Enhanced Reliability
	\item Optimised Resource Utilisation
	\item Compatibility with Low-Performance Systems
	\item Memory footprint clarity
	\item System Synchronisation
\end{enumerate}
These modifications to DocetOS are a significant step towards meeting the current demands required of real-time embedded systems and provide an opportunity to investigate known techniques used in the professional industry. This report provides a detailed account of the modifications, their rationale, and the anticipated benefits, resulting in a product that can be modified for use in future applications. \hfill\break
